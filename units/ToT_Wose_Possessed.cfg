    description= _ "They look much like normal woses, though looks can be decieving. First seen short after the discovery that experimentation on the living and the dead was conducted by some sort of necromancers, these wose's are much unlike normal woses. Very little is known about them, other than the fact that they seem to be very resistant to cold based attacks due to their necromantic nature."
