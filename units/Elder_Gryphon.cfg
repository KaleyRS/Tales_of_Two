    description= _ "Once a gryphon learns the ways of the world, they usually perish, for it is harsh and full of dangers. Gryphons are prideful hunters after all, and can be vulnerable in small numbers. But brood of Elder Gryphons are different, they have the unique ability to live longer than normal gryphons which will carry over for generations. These Elder Gryphons are both resilient, deadly, and no longer fear to face their enemies head on. It is believed that Elder Gryphons are actually imbued with magic, as their strengths are said to be otherworldly."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_OVERWHELING}
